;; The instrument section - in which the instruments are designed.
;; Each instrument consists of a set of unit generators, or software modules, 
;; which are patched together with i/o blocks â€” i-, k-, or a-rate variables.

;; The four types of variables are:
;; setup only
;; i-rate variables, changed at the note rate
;; k-rate variables, changed at the control signal rate
;; a-rate variables, changed at the audio signal rate

;; Each statement occupies a single line and has the same basic format:
;; result action arguments
